    "# Extract Lemmatization from ORACC JSON: Basic Parser\n",
    "The code in this notebook will parse [ORACC](http://oracc.org) `JSON` files to extract lemmatization data for one or more projects. The resulting `csv` (Comma Separated Values) file is named `parsed.csv` and has two fields: a Text ID (e.g. `dcclt/Q000039`) and a string of lemmas in the format `lugal[king]N` (or `Å¡arru[king]N` for Akkadian texts).\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the Basic Parser contains *only* text IDs and lemmas. This format is useful for so-called [bag of words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model) techniques such as word clouds or [topic modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model). The `JSON` files, however, contain a wealth of other data, including language (Sumerian, Akkadian, Emesal, etc.), orthographic form, morphology (currently only for Sumerian and Emesal), line numbers, breakage, etc. The extended JSON parser notebook, building upon the techniques demonstrated here, will show how to extract any type of data."

The code checks for a key `f`, if it exists the value of that key (another dictionary) is appended to the list `lemm_l`.
