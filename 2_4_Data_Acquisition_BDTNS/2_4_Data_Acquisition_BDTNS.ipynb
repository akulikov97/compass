    "# 2.4 Data Acquision BDTNS\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal of this notebook is to transform [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es/) data into a structured format that clearly distinguishes between text and non-text (such as line numbers) and that, for the text part, follows as much as possible the standards of the Oracc Global Sign List ([OGSL](http://oracc.org/ogsl)). Adherence to the [OGSL](http://oracc.org/ogsl) standard makes it possible to transform a line of text into a sequence of sign names or Unicode codepoints. This can be used to track transliteration inconsistencies, for instance in the rendering of names (U₂-da-mi-ša-ru-um vs. U₂-ta₂-mi-ša-ru-um), to build a search engine that finds a sign sequence regardless of the actual transliteration, or to compare editions of the same text in [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es/), [CDLI](http://cdli.ucla.edu), and [ePSD2](http://oracc.org/epsd2/admin/u3adm).\n",
    "\n",
    "The search engine will be built in a separate notebook - primarily as a case study of the potential of this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es/) website, search results can be downloaded with the \"Export\" button in the left pane. Searching for the empty string will select all texts currently available. The export creates two files: one with transliterations and one with meta-data. The transliteration file is discussed here most extensively. The file name is \"query_text_\" followed by a date and an additional number. Move the file to the `data` directory of this chapter and make sure that the variable `file` corresponds to your file name and file location.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses the `regex` module for regular expressions, rather than the standard `re` module. The `regex` module has more extensive support for Unicode, in particular in classifying characters as letters ('a', 'b', 'š', 'ṭ') versus non-letters ('\\[', '6', or '~'). The `regex` module needs to be installed before it can be imported (for installing modules, see Chapter 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook also uses the `pandas` integration of the `tqdm` package, for showing a progress bar. This is important, because the the transformation of (currently) more than 1.1 million lines of text in [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es) takes some time. The pandas/tqdm integration is initialized with `tqdm.pandas()`, immediately after importing `tqdm`. This allows the usage of the functions `progress_apply()` and `progress_map()` instead of the standard `apply()` and `map()` functions in `pandas`."

    "The [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es/) export file is read as a list (each line is one element in the list) with the `splitlines()` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "[BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es/) uses so-called \"vertical tabs\" (represented by `^K`, `\\v`, or `\\x0b`, depending on your editor) as a new line within a single text, whereas the standard newline (`\\n`) character is used to separate one text from the next. The Python `readlines()` function (which reads a file line-by-line, producing a list) keeps the vertical tabs and will result in a format where each document is represented as a single line. Instead, therefore, we read the entire file with the `read()` function and then split the document into lines with `splitlines()`. The function `splitlines()` takes the vertical tab (as well as the regular newline character) as a line separator; this will result in a line-by-line representation of the document in the form of a list (called `bdtns`)."

In some cases, x-values have been assigned an index number in [OGSL](http://oracc.org/ogsl). In those cases (nigarₓ = nigar; nemurₓ(PIRIG.TUR) = nemur₂; nagₓ(GAZ) = nag₃; and pešₓ(ŠU.PEŠ5) = peš₁₄) the appropriate index number is added and the sign name is ignored.\n",

First, instead of 'ziₓ' we may encounter \\[z\\]iₓ or some other usage of flags that indicate certainty or breakage. Second, 'subX' should not match 'munsubX'. Third, not every X indicates an x-value - X is also used (less frequently) for illegible signs, as in KA×X, or simply X.\n",

First, it tests whether the sought-for x-value is present in the line - if not, we go to the next x-value in the dictionary. Because of possible flags, the test is not done on the actual line, but on a \"translated\" version of the line. The function `translate()` takes a table and translates characters into other characters. In the present case, each character is replaced by `None`- which means they are removed. Note that the flags are not removed from the actual transliteration - they are only removed in the `if` statement to test for the presence of the target string. The search for the target word is done with a regular expression that surrounds the word with `\\\\b` and `\\\\b`. The `\\\\b` represents the \"word boundary\". Note that in regular expressions word boundaries include the hyphen, and various brackets, so that '\\\\\\bgurX\\\\\\b' matches with 'in-gurX'.\n",

The sequence \\\\p{L} indicates any letter in any Unicode alphabet - but excludes numbers, punctuation, etc. This convention is not available in the `re` library (the most commonly used library for regular expressions), but it can be used in the `regex` library, which replaces `re` in cases where more expansive Unicode support is necessary."
