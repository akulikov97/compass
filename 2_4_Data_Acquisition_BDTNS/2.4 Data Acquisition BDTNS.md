## 2.4 Data Acquisition BDTNS

The Database of Neo-Sumerian Text ([BDTNS][]) was created by Manuel Molina (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas). The site provides a detailed catalog of the administrative, legal, and epistolary  tablets from the so-called Ur III period (21st century BCE). Molina estimates that museums and private collections all over the world may hold at least 120,000 such documents, not including the holdings of the Iraq Museum (Baghdad). Currently, almost 65% of those documents are available through [BDTNS][] in transliteration, and/or in photograph and line drawing. 

There is a considerable overlap in the data sets offered by [CDLI][] and [BDTNS][]. All photographs and line drawings of Ur III tablets that are available in [CDLI][] have been imported in [BDTNS][]; in addition, [BDTNS][] offers its own collection of thousands of photographs, in particular of tablets now in the British Museum, London. The initial core of the [BDTNS][] transliterations was provided by Remco de Maaijer and Bram Jagersma, who prepared tens of thousands of Ur III texts and distributed those data freely. This same set of transliterations was also one of the initial data sets of [CDLI][]. Close cooperation between the two projects has led to further exchange of data.

Still, [BDTNS][] is not simply a duplicate of the Ur III data in [CDLI][]. Most Ur III scholars today prefer [BDTNS][] over [CDLI][] because the smaller focus of the Spanish project implies that there is more attention to detail and that more effort is made to update the record. One example is the book *Der König und sein Kreis* (2012)[^1] in which Paola Paoletti studied in detail several hundred documents from the so-called treasure archive. This archive reports on the manufacturing of luxury objects made of precious metals and leather and includes many rare words. Since the archive (like almost all Ur III archives) is scattered in museums all over the world, most of these texts were published as single documents or in small groups. Studying the entire group frequently allowed Paoletti to arrive at a more satisfying reading and understanding than the original editor's. The [BDTNS][] editions of these texts reflect Paoletti's improvements, but the [CDLI][] editions not (yet).

The [BDTNS][] data can be downloaded by hand through the Search option in the Catalogue & Transliterations drop-down menu.  One can search by a variety of criteria (including word and grapheme strings) and then download the search results by clicking on the Export button. The export page provides options for the type of information to include (various types of meta-data and/or transliterations). By searching for a blank string one may export the entire data set. The export yields two files: one for the meta-data and one for the  transliterations, both in raw text (`.txt`) format.

## 2.4.1 Vertical TABs

The [BDTNS][] transliteration files use "vertical TABs", represented by ^K, \v, or \x0b (depending on which editor is used for reading the file). These "vertical TABS" are inserted between lines that belong to the same document; the regular newline character is used to separate one document from the next. Because of those vertical tabs, the following code will lead to somewhat problematic results:

```python
with open("query_text_19_03_1-210747.txt", encoding="utf8") as b: 
    bdtns = b.readlines()
```

The `readlines()` function does not recognize the vertical tab as a newline character. The code, therefore, will result in a list that has one entry for every document, with ^K separating the lines. The issue can be circumvented by reading the entire document in one string with the `read()` function, and then split the string with the `splitlines()` function, as follows:

```python
with open("query_text_19_03_1-210747.txt", encoding="utf8") as b: 
    bdtns = b.read.splitlines()
```

The `splitlines()` function does recognize the vertical tab as a newline character, and this code results in a list with each line in the original `.txt` file in a separate entry.

## 2.4.2 Format as DataFrame

In order to format this data in a DataFrame we first need to look for lines that indicate a new document. In the [BDTNS][] export file such lines begin with a six-digit number, for instance:

> 	038576	AAICAB 1/1, Ashm. 1911-146 = CDLI P142659

We can isolate the [BDTNS][] number (which can also be used to create a URL of the format [http://bdtns.filol.csic.es/038576]) by selecting the first six characters of the line:

```python
if line[:6].isdigit(): 
	bdtns_no = line[:6]
```

All other lines are transliteration lines that may have one or more of the following:

- line number in the format 'o.ii 5' (obverse column ii line 5)
- transliteration
- editorial remarks

Line numbers are separated from transliteration by five spaces. Editorial remarks (which may indicate the presence of a seal impression, an erased line, or provide an alternative reading) are introduced by the hash mark and are placed at the end of the line. A specific type of editorial remark is the sign name, which explains an x-value (see below section ###), a rare sign form or a rare sign reading. These editorial remarks have the form (=SIGN NAME).

The script replaces the five spaces with a hash mark and '(=' with '#(=', so that we can use the hash mark to split the line in (potentially) three elements: line number, transliteration, and editorial comment. Both types of editorial comments (sign names and true comments) end up in the third column. We then prefix each line with the [BDTNS][] number that was isolated previously, and with a counter (`id_line`) that is set to zero for each new document. The field `id_line` is an integer that can be used to keep or to restore the proper order of the lines within a document. The full code looks as follows:

```python
l = []
bdtns_no = ""
id_line = 0
for line in tqdm.tqdm(bdtns): 
    if line[:6].isdigit(): 
        bdtns_no = line[:6]
        id_line = 0
        continue
    else: 
      	id_line += 1
        li = line.strip()
        li = li.replace("(=", "#(=", 1).replace('     ', '#', 1)
        li_l = li.split('#', 2)
        li_l = [bdtns_no, id_line] + li_l
        l.append(li)
```

This results in a list of lists called `l` that contains the same data as the original `bdtns` list, but in a different format. This list of lists is transformed into a five-column DataFrame with column names `id_text` (the [BDTNS][] number), `id_line` (an integer, starting at 0 for each document), `label` (the traditional line number), `text` (transliteration), and `comments` (holding comments as well as sign explications).

## 2.4.3 X-values

A second peculiarity of the [BDTNS][] data set is the way so-called x-values are represented. In Assyriology, x-values are sign readings that have not (yet) received a conventional index number. For instance, the (very common) word  for "to cut (reeds)" is written either with the sign **zi** or with the sign **SIG₇**. Based on the distribution of those spellings (**SIG₇** only in Umma, **zi** elsewhere), M. Molina and M. Such-Guttiérez (2004)[^2] concluded that both spellings write the same word /**zi**/. On that basis the new reading **/zi/** for the sign **SIG₇** was introduced (and is now commonly accepted among Sumerologists). In such cases one may transliterate **ziₓ(SIG₇)** where the SIG₇ between brackets is the name of the sign transliterated as **ziₓ** (and thus the principle of a one-to-one mapping of a transliterated token to a cuneiform sign is maintained). In the [BDTNS][] export file this is represented as follows: 

> 	o. 2     gi ziX-a 12 sar-⌈ta⌉ (=SIG7)		"cut reed per 12 *sar* of field"

The index ₓ is represented by a capital X (as in ziX), and the sign name is added at the end of the line, between parens and preceded by the equal sign. 

In order to use this data for computational purposes (for instance computing sign frequencies) it is necessary to move the sign specification and to transform this into

> 	o. 2     gi ziₓ(SIG7)-a 12 sar-⌈ta⌉ 

It is possible to do so automatically, and to move the sign name to the position immediately after the capital X. Before we do so, it is useful to inspect some exceptions to the pattern. In some cases sign names are provided for rare readings, for instance:

> 	18 gin2 nagga mu-kuX gibil (=AN.NA) (=DU)

If we simply move the first sign name to the first X, we will get:

> 	18 gin2 nagga mu-kuX(AN.NA) gibil  (=DU)

(=AN.NA), in this case, explains the rare reading **nagga** (tin, or some similar substance), whereas (=DU) explains **kuX** - but there is no obvious way for a regular expression or script to recognize that. Another type of exception is reduplicated "gurₓ-gurₓ" which is represented thus:

> 6.0.0 še ur5-ra še gurX-gurX-ta su-ga (=ŠE.KIN.ŠE.KIN)

which, if we naively moved the sign name, would result in:

> 	6.0.0 še ur5-ra še gurₓ(ŠE.KIN.ŠE.KIN)-gurₓ-ta su-ga

The issue is solved by approaching the x-values in two separate ways. First, unambiguous x-values (those that are always resolved in the same way) are replaced with the help of a dictionary that lists the x-values with their resolutions. This dictionary includes the most common x-values encountered in [BDTNS][]. Second, for ambiguous x-values the sign explication in [BDTNS][] is used. The function `ogsl_v()` is applied to each row  of the DataFrame, using the `tqdm` library to keep track of progress. In order to do so `tqdm` is imported as follows:

```python
from tqdm.auto import tqdm
tqdm.pandas()
```

Importing `tqdm` from the `tqdm.auto` submodule allows `tqdm` to run either in notebook mode (with colored progress bars) or in regular mode. The expression `tqdm.pandas()` initiates the `pandas` integration and allows the use of `progress_apply()` and `progress_map()` instead of the regular `pandas` functions `apply()` and `map()`.

In addition to resolving x-values, the function `ogsl_v()` also replaces regular numbers (as in **du3**) by unicode index numbers (**du₃**). For `ogsl_v()` to run properly and efficiently, a number of translation tables, dictionaries, and compiled regular expressions are defined before the function is called. A detailed explanation of how `ogsl_v()` works is found in the notebook itself.

The resulting DataFrame distinguishes between text data (the column `text`) and other data (line numbers, comments, text ID numbers) and follows as much as possible the specifications of the ORACC Global Sign List ([OGSL](http://oracc.org/ogsl)).

## 2.4.4 Save

Finally, the newly created DataFrame with [BDTNS][] data is saved in two ways. The `to_pickle()` function of the `pandas` library is used to created a pickle, a file that can be opened in a future session to recreate the DataFrame. Second, the DataFrame is saved in JSON format, a format that is more suitable for sharing with other researchers. Both files are directed to the `output` directory.
