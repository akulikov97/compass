These steps do not work well for the present data set. The adapted version, named `lexicalrichness_v` is imported from the `utils` directory.

    "Lexical richness measures the variation in vocabulary usage. Texts that use a relatively low number of unique lexemes (repeat the same words all over the place) receive a low lexical richness score. Texts that use the lexicon more ingenuously, using synonyms or circumscriptions to refer to the same concept, receive a higher lexical richness score. Lexical richness is used, among other things, to identify texts written by language learners, to assess aphasia, or to measure the difficulty of a text. For Sumerian literature, we may expect that compositions with high levels of repetition, such as certain hymns and narratives, end up with a low lexical richness score, whereas disputation texts or other compositions that actively explore the lexicon may have a higher score.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most straightforward lexical richness score is the Type Token Ratio (or TTR), which simply divides the number of unique lexemes by the total number of lexemes. This is a fine measurement to compare texts of (approximately) equal length, but does not work well for a corpus with texts of very different length, as is the case here. Short texts have higher TTR values than long texts, because longer texts will by necessity use the same words over and over again and (in English) function words such as \"the\" or \"in\" will be repeated many times whatever the lexical ingenuity of the author. A better measurement is called MTLD or Measure of Textual Lexical Diversity ([McCarthy and Jarvis 2010](https://doi.org/10.3758/BRM.42.2.381)). The MTLD value is calculated as the mean number of words in a text that will bring TTR from 1 (at the first word in the text) down to a threshold value (default is 0.720). In practice that means that a text is cut in many small units, each with approximately the same TTR - eliminating the effect of text length. This is a promising approach that may well work for Sumerian and a Python module that includes MTLD is available ([lexicalrichness](https://pypi.org/project/lexicalrichness/)). Its usage here, however, is experimental and preliminary. The threshold value is based on the observation that when going through a text sequentially the TTR in any text will drop drastically as soon as the first repeated word is encountered. At some place in the text the TTR will stabilize and drop only very gradually later on. That place is approximated by the default TTR threshold value of 0.720. It seems likely, however, that a valid threshold value is language dependent and that a language with very few function words, such as the literary register of Sumerian, might need a higher value (function words drag the TTR down). On the other hand, a corpus of texts with very substantial repetition (occasionaly repetition of entire lengthy passages) may well require a lower threshold. "

The most common use case is a corpus of raw documents (probably in English), each of them consisting of a text string that needs to be pre-processed  and tokenized (turned into a list of words or lemmas) before anything else can be done. Default pre-processing includes, for instance, lowercasing the entire text (so that thursday, Thursday, and THURSDAY will all be recognized as the same lemma) and removal of punctuation and numbers. Default tokenizers assume that the text is in a modern (western) language, taking spaces, hyphens, and punctuation marks as word dividers. The structure of the [ORACC](http://oracc.org) data is much simpler than that. Pre-processing is unnecessary, and tokenization should split the string *only* at blank spaces.\n",
