Longer texts will have more vocabulary items (and Multiple Word Expressions) in common with the lexical corpus than shorter texts, but that does not tell us anything.

    "> The [LexicalRichness](https://pypi.org/project/lexicalrichness/) package by Lucas Shen has been slightly adapted for the present purposes. The package expects a data set in the English language in a raw text format that must be pre-processed (removal of interpunction, digits, etc.) and tokenized (cut up into individual words). These steps are unnecessary (and indeed impossible) for the present data set. The adapted version, named `lexicalrichness_v` can be imported from the `utils` directory. The usage information in the [LexicalRichness](https://pypi.org/project/lexicalrichness/) website is valid for `lexicalrichness_v` with the following exceptions:\n",
    "- the option use_TextBlob in LexicalRichness() is removed\n",
    "- the option use_tokenizer in LexicalRichness is added; default is use_tokenizer = False.\n",

    "### 3.2.1 Basic Statistics of the [epsd2/literary](http://oracc.org/epsd2/literary) Corpus\n",
    "In computing the relationship between lexical and literary vocabulary text length is playing a big role. A long text will likely have more overlap with lexical vocabulary than a very short one. The [epsd2/literary](http://oracc.org/epsd2/literary) corpus includes compositions that are known only from a fragmentary *incipit*, as well as compositions that are more than a thousand lines long.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to meaningfully compare these compositions we will first eliminate all texts that have fewer than 200 lemmas and/or MWEs. Second, we will collect data on text length and lexical variation (how many unique lemmas are used in this text?). Dividing lexical variation by text length provides the \"Type to Token Ratio\" or TTR. \n",
    "\n",
    "TTR is generally considered to be a poor measurement for lexical richness. Short texts have higher TTR values than long texts, because longer texts will by necessity use the same words over and over again and function words such as \"the\" or \"in\" will be repeated many times whatever the lexical ingenuity of the author. A better measurement is called MTLD or Measure of Textual Lexical Diversity ([McCarthy and Jarvis 2010](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BRM.42.2.381)). The MTLD value is calculated as the mean number of words in a text that will bring TTR from 1 (at the first word in the text) down to a threshold value (default is 0.720). In practice that means that a text is cut in many small units, each with approximately the same TTR - eliminating the effect of text length. This is a promising approach that may well work for Sumerian and a Python module that includes MTLD is available ([lexicalrichness](https://pypi.org/project/lexicalrichness/)). Its usage here, however, is experimental and preliminary. The threshold value is based on the observation that when going through a text sequentially the TTR in any text will drop drastically as soon as the first repeated word is encountered. At some place in the text the TTR will stabilize and drop only very gradually later on. That place is approximated by the default threshold value of 0.720. It seems likely, however, that a valid threshold value is language dependent and that a language with very few function words, such as the literary register of Sumerian, might need a lower value. "

    "\n",
    "The corpus is transformed into a Document Term Matrix (or DTM), a table in which each column represents a word (or expression) that appears in a lexical text and each row represents a Sumerian composition. Each cell is a number, 0 or 1, indicating whether or not that word appears  in a particular composition. This is a binary DTM, non-binary DTMS give the number of times a word appears in a composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since DTMs are very commonly used in computational text analysis, it is worth spending a bit more time on various ways in which they can be created for cuneiform data. The function `CountVectorizer()` (from the `Sklearn` package) is a very flexible tool with many possible parameters. How `CountVectorizer()` and its counterpart `TfidfVectorizer()` are used depends on the structure of the input data. The most common use case is a corpus of raw documents (probably in English), each of them consisting of a text string that needs to be pre-processed and tokenized before anything else can be done. Default pre-processing includes, for instance, lowercasing the entire text. Default tokenizers assume that the text is in a modern (western) language and take spaces and punctuation marks as word dividers. Cuneiform data, whether in transliteration, lemmatization, or in normalization is much simpler than most modern language texts, because the only type of word boundary is a space (or a sequence of spaces). When using `CountVectorizer()` on transliterated, lemmatized, or normalized text we can use the parameter `token_pattern = r'[^ ]+'`, meaning \"any sequence of characters, except space.\" \n",
    "```python\n",
    "cv = CountVectorizer(token_pattern= r'[^ ]+')\n",
    "```\n",
    "A second situation is where we want to use data that is already in a list format (is already preprocessed and tokenized). This is uncommon in general, but very common for cuneiform data: all the [ORACC](http://oracc.org) and [ETCSL](http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk) data fall into that category. Rather than transforming the tokenized text back into raw strings and then tokenize those strings, we can use the parameters `tokenizer` and `preprocessor` to take care of that situation. These parameters take a function as their value, the function should return a list with tokenized text. If our input already is a list with tokenized text we may call a dummy function - a function that simply returns the list it receives. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "def dummy(l):\n",
    "    return(l)\n",
    "cv = CountVectorizer(tokenizer=dummy, preprocessor=dummy)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will prevent `Countvectorizer()` from using a default tokenizer and preprocessor (which do not accept the list input) and it saves the trouble of untokenizing and then tokenizing again (See the [blog post](http://www.davidsbatista.net/blog/2018/02/28/TfidfVectorizer/) on this subject by David Batista). Instead of defining a `dummy()` function we can reach the same effect with a lambda function (see the code below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can choose to use the `MWETokenizer()` discussed above (section ###). The `MWETokenizer()` expects a tokenized text (a list) and re-tokenizes that text by using a list of pre-defined Multiple Word Expressions, returning a new list. In case we use the original [epsd2/literary](http://oracc.org/epsd2/literary) data, in which the MWEs have not yet been marked, we can do the CountVectorizing and marking the MWEs in one go, as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",

    "tokenizer = MWETokenizer(lex_mwe) # initialize the tokenizer with the lexical MWEs\n",
    "cv = CountVectorizer(tokenizer=tokenizer.tokenize, preprocessor=dummy)\n",
    "```\n",
    "For our current purposes the best approach is to use a dummy tokenizer and preprocessor. The disadvantage of using the MWETokenizer on entire texts is that it will not honor line boundaries. See, for instance, Gilgameš and Huwawa 50-51 (text and translation [ETCSL](http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.1.8.1.5&display=Crit&charenc=gcirc#)): \n",

The number of such errors, however, is fairly small (about 6 for a corpus of almost 400 texts). For other types of texts, where line boundaries are less significant, this method may well be an efficient way of doing things.\n",
