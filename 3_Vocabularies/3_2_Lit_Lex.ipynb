Each cell is a number, 0 or 1, indicating whether or not that word appears  in a particular composition. This is a binary DTM, non-binary DTMS give the number of times a word appears in a composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since DTMs are very commonly used in computational text analysis, it is worth spending a bit more time on various ways in which they can be created for cuneiform data. The function `CountVectorizer()` (from the `Sklearn` package) is a very flexible tool with many possible parameters. How `CountVectorizer()` and its counterpart `TFIDFVectorizer()` are used depends on the structure of the input data. The most common use case is a corpus of raw documents (probably in English), each of them consisting of a text string that needs to be pre-processed and tokenized before anything else can be done. Default pre-processing includes, for instance, lowercasing the entire text. Default tokenizers assume that the text is in a modern (western) language and take spaces and punctuation marks as word dividers. Cuneiform data, whether in transliteration, lemmatization, or in normalization is much simpler than most modern language texts, because the only type of word boundary is a space (or a sequence of spaces). When using `CountVectorizer()` on transliterated, lemmatized, or normalized text we can use the parameter `token_pattern = r'[^ ]+'`, meaning \"any sequence of characters, except space.\" \n",
    "```python\n",
    "cv = CountVectorizer(token_pattern= r'[^ ]+')\n",
    "```\n",
    "A second situation is where we want to use data that is already in a list format (is already preprocessed and tokenized). All the [ORACC](http://oracc.org) and [ETCSL](http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk) data fall into that category. Rather than transforming the tokenized text back into raw strings and then tokenize those strings, we can use the parameters `tokenizer` and `preprocessor` to take care of that situation. These parameters take a function as their value, the function should return a list with tokenized text. If our input already is a list with tokenized text we can call a dummy function - a function that simply returns the list it receives. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "def dummy(l):\n",
    "    return(l)\n",
    "cv = CountVectorizer(tokenizer=dummy, preprocessor=dummy)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will prevent `Countvectorizer()` from using a default tokenizer and preprocessor (which do not accept the list input) and it saves the trouble of untokenizing and then tokenizing again (See the [blog post](http://www.davidsbatista.net/blog/2018/02/28/TfidfVectorizer/) on this subject by David Batista). Instead of defining a `dummy()` function we can reach the same effect with a lambda function (see the code below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can choose to use the `MWETokenizer()` discussed above (section ###). The `MWETokenizer()` expects a tokenized text (a list) and re-tokenizes that text by using a list of pre-defined Multiple Word Expressions, returning a new list. In case we use the original [ETCSL](http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk) data, in which the MWEs have not yet been marked, we can do the CountVectorizing and marking the MWEs in one go, as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",

    "tokenizer = MWETokenizer(lex_mwe) # initialize the tokenizer with the lexical MWEs\n",
    "cv = CountVectorizer(tokenizer=tokenizer.tokenize, preprocessor=dummy)\n",
    "```\n",
    "For our current purposes the best approach is to use a dummy tokenizer and preprocessor. The disadvantage of using the MWETokenizer on entire texts is that it will not honor line boundaries. See, for instance, Gilgameš and Huwawa 50-51 (text and translation [ETCSL](http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.1.8.1.5&display=Crit&charenc=gcirc#): \n",

The number of such errors is fairly small (about 6 for a corpus of almost 400 texts). For other types of texts, where line boundaries are less significant, this method may well be an efficient way of doing things.\n",

    "The Gudea Cylinders and Lugal-e (or Ninurta's Exploits) have the highest number of matches (669 and 624) with the lexical texts chosen. But those are also the two longest compositions in the corpus. We can normalize by dividing the total number of matches by text length, and then order again on the normalized match (`norm1`). Since, however, we are working with a *binary* model of our data (presence/absence of a lemma), it may make more sense to divide the number of matches by the number of unique lemmas in the text (`norm2`)."
