# 1. Introduction

This book project attempts to bring together two recent trends: the digital turn in Assyriology, and the rise of Data Science. Although Assyriologists had actively used databases since the nineteen sixties, such data sets were available only to a small circle. With the advent of the Internet, it became possible to give access to data in the form of transliterations, translation, photographs, and glossaries to the entire world. This development began in earnest in 1996 with the appearance of the Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature ([ETCSL][ETCSL]), and continues to the present day. Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that draws primarily from Statistics and Computer Science and usually involves a third field, the domain discipline. Although "Data Science" is a relatively recent coinage, its roots go back well into the twentieth century. In recent years many universities have created institutes or departments for Data Science and/or for Digital Humanities, and have developed undergraduate or graduate programs in such fields. The eco-system for applying Data Science methods to Assyriological data, therefore, is much better today than it was even five years ago. 

This Introduction will briefly discuss the history of the digital turn in Assyriology and some relevant aspects of developments in Data Science (1.1). Next we will discuss software and installing software (1.2), with a brief discussion of differences between Windows and Mac. Section 1.3 is devoted to principles of Data Science in Assyriology: open data, open source, and reproducibility.

## 1.1 Assyriology and Data Science

The turn towards publicly available electronic data is due in no small part to the initiative by Jeremy Black to develop the Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature ([ETCSL][ETCSL]) which started in 1996 and remained active until 2006, when it became archival. Initially [ETCSL][ETCSL] offered composite editions (transliterations) of Sumerian literary texts with translations. In version 2, the entire corpus was lemmatized, which allowed for the addition of glossaries and other tools for search and research.  

[ETCSL][ETCSL] was quickly followed by the Cuneiform Digital Library Inititative ([CDLI][CDLI]), created by Bob Englund, UCLA. This project provides access to metadata, photographs, line drawings, and transliterations (occasionally also translations) of cuneiform texts of all periods and genres. Importantly, [CDLI][CDLI] assigns unique ID numbers to cuneiform objects. In 2006 (after several precursors) the Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus ([ORACC][ORACC]) conglomerate of projects was built by Steve Tinney (University of Pennsylvania), who was also involved in the development of both [ETCSL][ETCSL] and [CDLI][CDLI]. 

These three projects together fundamentally changed research and teaching in Assyriology and many Assyriologists today depend in one way or another on these and other digital resources[^1]. Together, they made available large amounts of searchable data and made those data freely accessible to other scholars. This was a departure from traditional scholarship in numerous ways. Traditionally, scholars jealously guarded their data until it resulted in a final publication. Data in [ETCSL][ETCSL], [CDLI][CDLI], and [ORACC][ORACC] is freely available, but is also more provisional than what one finds in print publications. In addition, the issue of searchability put a lot more emphasis on standards for transliteration and lemmatization. Transliteration standards for Akkadian are pretty well established, but for Sumerian one may find the same word transliterated as gu₄ or gud (ox) and the same nominal phrase as udu-babbar or udu babbar (white sheep).

The relevant developments in Data Science may be described first in terms of Natural Language Processing and second in terms of software tools. Natural Language Processing, one branch of Data Science, has flourished in particular in response to the success of the World Wide Web and developments in computer speech recognition. Search engines need efficient ways to determine which pages are likely to be relevant in response to a user's search entry. This led to concepts such as TF-IDF (Text Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency), a fairly straightforward statistical measure (or family of measures) now widely used not only in search engines, but in all kinds of research projects that deal with language. The development of various types of Neural Networks proved to be of immense importance for Optical Character Recognition and computer Speech Recognition. Such developments are initially driven by commercial interests, but also yield tools that are useful for research purposes in various areas.  On the software side, the introduction of the [Jupyter Notebook](jupyter) (developed by Fernando Pérez, UC Berkeley) fundamentally changed research and teaching in Data Science. [Jupyter][jupyter] is an application that allows one to run Python (or one of many other programming languages) in a (local) page of a web browser. The [Jupyter Notebook][jupyter] mixes interactive code with code explanation, and shows the results of its computations (including visualizations) in that same web page. [Jupyter Notebooks][jupyter] can easily be transformed into HTML for web publication and can be rendered by [Github][git] (a popular software development platform).

Taken together, the developments in (digital) Assyriology and in Data Science provide the background against which this project developed. Assyriological web publications provide a convenient way to pull up a text edition (and, with any luck, the corresponding photograph), or to search large amounts of data - essentially upscaling traditional approaches to cuneiform text. With input from Data Science, they also enable the search for patterns, not immediately available to the naked eye.
