# Compass

The Computational Assyriology project provides examples of Assyriological research questions that can be approached computationally. The project consists of an e-Book (forthcoming) , supplemented by a Github repo. The book will contain introductory text, explanation of research questions, and discussions of the structure of the code. The Github repo contains [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org) that can execute this same code. The two thus belong together and are meant to be used together.

In order to run the Jupyter Notebooks, please install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) for Python 3.5 or higher. Anaconda is available for Mac, Windows, and Linux. The distribution includes Python, Jupyter, and a host of frequently used Python libraries.

Compass is developed by Niek Veldhuis, Professor of Assyriology at the University of California at Berkeley. The project was made possible by a [Humanities Research Fellowship](https://ls.berkeley.edu/academic-programs/arts-humanities/humanities-research-fellowship-mellon-project-grant) from the Division of Arts & Sciences, UC Berkeley.
